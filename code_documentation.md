Documenting lab code is tricky because it needs to accomplish two (sometimes opposing) tasks:
1. Allow lab members to run the code without spending a lot of time trying to figure things out. These users might know next to nothing about programming, so simpler is better.
2. Allow programmers to understand and update the code when needed.
